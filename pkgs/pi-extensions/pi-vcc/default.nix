  # pi-vcc ships raw TypeScript (pi.extensions = ["./index.ts"]) that pi loads
  # directly. Its package.json declares NO `dependencies` at all — only
  # peerDependencies (@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent, typebox), both of which
  # pi injects at runtime (see the "Available Imports" table in pi's
  # docs/extensions.md). buildNpmPackage would therefore install nothing, so a
  # plain copy is sufficient and correct (mirrors pi-autoresearch).
  #
  # Upstream declares no `files` field, so the runtime set is spelled out here:
  # tests/, benchmarks/ and scripts/ are dev-only, and demo.gif is a 16MB
  # README asset. The install path matches pi's piPackageRoot helper, which
  # resolves lib/node_modules/<pname>.
